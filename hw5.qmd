```{python}
#| include: false
## Read Dataset
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("wdi.csv")
df.head()
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
## summary statistics table
indicators = ["unemployment_rate","life_expectancy","gdp_per_capita"]
summary = df[indicators].describe().T
summary = summary[["count","mean","std","min","25%","50%","75%","max"]]
summary
```

## Findings from summary
-The gdp per capita distribution has a wide range of values. The maximum gdp per capita is more than 10x the minimum.

-The life expectancy variable is relatively concentrated â€” over half of the countries have a life expectancy between 70-80 years.

-The unemployment rate of countries is also concentrated with the mean being 7.27% and the 75% quantile being 9.46%. However, the maximum unemployment rate is 37.85%. 

```{python}
#| echo: false 
#| label: fig-gdpvslifeexp
#| fig-cap: "This figure is a scatter plot of GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy for countries in the dataset"

#make graphs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(df["gdp_per_capita"], df["life_expectancy"])
plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy")
plt.title("GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy")
plt.show()
```
- As GDP increases, life expectancy increases. A higher GDP means more economic flourishing, allowing more of the country to have access to a healthier lifestyle.
```{python}
#| echo: false 
#| label: fig-unemployment
#| fig-cap: "This bar chart shows the top 10 countries with the highest unemployment rates"

top10 = df.sort_values("unemployment_rate", ascending=False).head(10)

plt.barh(top10["country"], top10["unemployment_rate"])
plt.xlabel("Rate (%)")
plt.title("Top 10 Countries With the Highest Unemployment Rate")
plt.show()
```
- Many of the countries on this list are in Africa.
